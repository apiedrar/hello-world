# hello-world
This repository is for practising the GitHub flow

I'm a Music Producer who's been working more consistently in audio engineering, found a new passion in coding along the way, and decided to make it my new career a couple months later. Same happened with finance a couple years earlier, although that's been maintained as a hobby so far.

This is my first README, so I'll be leaving it like this now.

Bye!
